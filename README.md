DD2419 VT24 Project Course in Robotics and Autonomous Systems (ROBPVT24)

We are glad to welcome you to DD2419 Project Course in Robotics and Autonomous Systems. During this course, you will

This course is an advanced course in computer science running over two periods and focusing on the broad, inter-disciplinary field of robotics. The emphasis in DD2419 is on showing how methods are used in practice and how they are integrated into a complete system. It follows up on the course DD2410, which gives a broad introduction to robotics. To keep things manageable and steer the learning in DD2419, the project task is predefined. So you will not be able to define your own project, but you will have loads of fun anyway! You will be working with a mobile robot equipped with an arm in the project. 

This is a project course that uses actual hardware and we, therefore, need to limit the number of students. It is a robotics project course that makes use of ROS and where we apply robotics rather than learn the basics. The assumption is thus that you have taken a robotics course before and that you know ROS. At KTH this corresponds to having taken course DD2410. You will be admitted in competition with other students. If your coordinator or you yourself add you to the course without getting an approval from the person responsible for the course you will not be planned for when ordering hardware and you might not be able to take the course. Please contact the teacher of the course if you have questions about the admission.

Students need to be ready to invest a significant amount of time. The course is worth 9hp which corresponds to 6 weeks of full time studies (i.e. 240h) and we expect you to spend this amount of time, i.e. a lot more than on most other courses worth 9hp. To take the course you need to be willing to invest this time.

Many or maybe even most of you will find that you spend a much smaller part of your time on doing "real" work than you would have thought. Welcome to the real world! For some of you this "pain" will start with having to use your computer as the powerful tool it is and not just as a device for typing reports on. All of you will experience that there is a big step from idea to actually implemented, tested and working code that realised that ideas and deals with an unknown environment.

We hope that you, by the end of this course, will have learned a lot more about robotics but equally important developed essential skills for your future life such, such as building software systems, managing your time and other limited resources and communicating with others in situations where you need to make compromises.
